The magnitudes and orientations of black hole spins offer a record of binaries\u2019 evolutionary history, encoding information about massive stellar evolution and the astrophysical environments in which binary black holes are assembled. Recent analyses of the binary black hole population have yielded conflicting portraits of the black hole spin distribution. Some works suggest that black hole spins are small but nonzero and exhibit a wide range of misalignment angles relative to binaries\u2019 orbital angular momenta. Other works conclude that the majority of black holes are nonspinning while the remainder are rapidly rotating and primarily aligned with their orbits. We revisit these conflicting conclusions, employing a variety of complementary methods to measure the distribution of spin magnitudes and orientations among binary black hole mergers. We find that the existence of a subpopulation of black holes with vanishing spins is not required by current data. Should such a subpopulation exist, we conclude that it must contain \u227260% of binaries. Additionally, we find evidence for significant spin\u2013orbit misalignment among the binary black hole population, with some systems exhibiting misalignment angles greater than 90\u00b0, and see no evidence for an approximately spin-aligned subpopulation.", "venue": "Astrophysical Journal Letters", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 61, "citationCount": 45, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3847/2041-8213/ac847e", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08574, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Binary systems containing one or two spinning black holes are particularly interesting due to spin-orbit (and eventual spin-spin) interactions and the opportunity of measuring spins directly through GW observations. In this Letter, we analyze simulated signals emitted by spinning binaries with several values of masses, spins, orientations, and signal-to-noise ratios, as detected by an advanced LIGO-Virgo network. We find that for moderate or high signal-to-noise ratio the spin magnitudes can be estimated with errors of a few percent (5%-30%) for neutron star-black hole (black hole-black hole) systems. Spins' tilt angle can be estimated with errors of 0.04\u00a0rad in the best cases, but typical values will be above 0.1\u00a0rad. Errors will be larger for signals barely above the threshold for detection. The difference in the azimuth angles of the spins, which may be used to check if spins are locked into resonant configurations, cannot be constrained. We observe that the best performances are obtained when the line of sight is perpendicular to the system's total angular momentum and that a sudden change of behavior occurs when a system is observed from angles such that the plane of the orbit can be seen both from above and below during the time the signal is in band. This study suggests that direct measurement of black hole spin by means of GWs can be as precise as what can be obtained from x-ray binaries.", "venue": "Physical Review Letters", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 76, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/88643/1/PhysRevLett.112.251101.pdf", "status": "GREEN", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0129, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
