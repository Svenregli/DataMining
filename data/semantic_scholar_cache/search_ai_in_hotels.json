Interviews were conducted with AI bots serving as the subjects. The rationale for this approach is that AI bots have undergone extensive training using a wide range of data from different internet sources. Therefore, having an interview with an AI bot can be viewed as an interaction with an entity that embodies collective viewpoints and information derived from the internet. The study has unearthed crucial themes that offer invaluable insights to industry participants and policymakers, contributing to the expansion of existing literature by generating novel knowledge and fostering a comprehensive understanding. The pioneering approach of incorporating AI bots as participants in interviews opens up fresh avenues for future research endeavours and engenders discussions and debates concerning the use of AI bots as participants.", "venue": "Journal of Applied Sciences in Travel and Hospitality", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 36, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.31940/jasth.v7i2.69-83", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.31940/jasth.v7i2.69-83?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.31940/jasth.v7i2.69-83, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This qualitative study employed 23 semi\u2010structured interviews to explore the perceptions of professionals on AI in luxury hotels in Greece. The findings highlight the benefits of AI\u2010enabled technologies in talent acquisition, including speed, reliability and enhanced candidate communication, however, human interaction remains pivotal at critical stages. The model proposed includes six stages in the AI\u2010Talent Acquisition process, serving as a practical guide for practitioners and researchers. This study contributes to the AI\u2010HRM strategic change field by offering theoretical and practical insights. To the best of the authors' knowledge, it represents one of the initial empirical attempts to develop a comprehensive AI\u2010Talent Acquisition framework, providing valuable implications for ongoing research and implementation in this domain.", "venue": "Strategic Change", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/jsc.2632", "status": "HYBRID", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1002/jsc.2632?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1002/jsc.2632, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
