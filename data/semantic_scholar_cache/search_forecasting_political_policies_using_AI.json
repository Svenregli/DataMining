Forecasting and identifying COVID-19 infection cases is crucial for the government at all levels because the pandemic grows exponentially and results in fatalities. Hence, by giving information about the spread of the epidemic, the government can move quickly at multiple levels to establish new policies and modalities in order to minimize the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on both public health and the economic sectors. Forecasting models for COVID-19 infection cases in the Ural region in Russia were developed using two deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) learning-based approaches namely Encoder\u2013Decoder LSTM and Attention LSTM algorithms. The models were evaluated based on five standard performance evaluation metrics which include Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root MSE (RMSE), Relative RMSE (RRMSE), and coefficient of determination (R2). However, the Encoder\u2013Decoder LSTM deep learning-based forecasting model achieved the best performance results (MSE=32794.09, MAE=168.56, RMSE=181.09, RRMSE=13.46, and R2=0.87) compared to the model developed with Attention LSTM models.", "venue": "Journal of intelligent systems and internet of things", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 5, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54216/jisiot.080202?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54216/jisiot.080202, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Our robust analysis framework includes descriptive, inferential, bivariate, multivariate methodologies, correlation analysis: Pearson's and Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, multiple logistic regression models, Multicollinearity Assessment, and Model Validation. In addressing heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation in error terms, we've advanced the precision and reliability of our regression analyses using the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Additionally, our application of the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model and the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models have enabled accurate time series forecasting. With this approach, we've achieved superior predictive accuracy and marked by a Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) of 0.800 and a Mean Error (ME) of -73.80 compared to a naive forecast. The project further extends its machine learning application by creating a random forest classifier model with a precision of 73%, a recall of 78%, and an F1-score of 73%. Building on this, we employed the H2O AutoML process to optimize our model selection, resulting in an XGBoost model that exhibits exceptional predictive power as evidenced by an RMSE of 0.1761205782994506 and MAE of 0.0874235576229789. Factor Analysis was leveraged to identify underlying variables or factors that explain the pattern of correlations within a set of observed variables. Scoring history, a tool to observe the model's performance throughout the training process was incorporated to ensure the highest possible performance of our machine learning models. We also incorporated Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, utilizing the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) model to comprehend the contributing factors to accident severity. Features such as Driver_Home_Area_Type, Longitude, Driver_IMD_Decile, Road_Type, Casualty_Home_Area_Type, and Casualty_IMD_Decile were identified as significant influencers. Our research contributes to the nuanced understanding of traffic accident severity and demonstrates the potential of advanced statistical, econometric, machine learning techniques in informing evidence based interventions and policies for enhancing road safety.", "venue": "Heliyon", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 51, "citationCount": 6, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13483", "status": "CLOSED", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13483, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
