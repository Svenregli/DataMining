Emergent phenomena may however appear in an open system, if, as established by the Edge of Chaos theory, some of its constitutive elements feature the capability to amplify infinitesimal fluctuations in energy, provided an external source supplies them with a sufficient amount of DC power, which is known to be a signature for locally-active behaviour. In particular, complex behaviours, including static and dynamic pattern formation, may emerge in arrays of identical diffusively-coupled cells, if and only if the basic unit is poised on a particular sub-domain of the Local Activity regime, referred to as Edge of Chaos, within which a quiet state hides in fact a high degree of excitability. Here we show, for the first time, that these counterintuitive phenomena may emerge in a basic memristor cellular neural network, consisting of two identical diffusively-coupled second-order cells. The proposed bio-inspired array represents the simplest ever-reported open system, which reproduces the shocking phenomenon, reported by Smale in 1974, when, while studying a model from cellular biology, he observed two identical reaction cells, \u201cmathematically dead\u201d on their own, pulsating together upon diffusive coupling. Impressively, the bio-inspired two-cell reaction-diffusion network contains only nine circuit elements, specifically two DC voltage sources, three linear resistors, two linear capacitors, and two functional niobium oxide (NbO) memristors from NaMLab. Applying the theory of Local Activity to an accurate model of the memristor oscillator, a comprehensive picture for its local and global dynamics may be drawn, providing a systematic method to tune the design parameters of the two-cell array to enable diffusion-driven instabilities therein.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems Part 1: Regular Papers", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 38, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/tcsi.2021.3133627?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/tcsi.2021.3133627, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, several studies have been performed with different methods, and novel and useful algorithms have been suggested to improve secure image encryption schemes. Nowadays, chaotic methods have been found in diverse fields, such as the design of cryptosystems and image encryption. Chaotic methods-based digital image encryptions are a novel image encryption method. This technique uses random chaos sequences for encrypting images, and it is a highly-secured and fast method for image encryption. Limited accuracy is one of the disadvantages of this technique. This paper researches the chaos sequence and wavelet transform value to find gaps. Thus, a novel technique was proposed for digital image encryption and improved previous algorithms. The technique is run in MATLAB, and a comparison is made in terms of various performance metrics such as the Number of Pixels Change Rate (NPCR), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Correlation coefficient, and Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI). The simulation and theoretical analysis indicate the proposed scheme\u2019s effectiveness and show that this technique is a suitable choice for actual image encryption.", "venue": "Entropy", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 77, "citationCount": 130, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/23/3/341/pdf", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7998182, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
