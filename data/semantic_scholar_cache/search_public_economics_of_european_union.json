The study is based on microdata of the Community Innovation Survey 2012\u20132014, covering a sample of 98,809 enterprises from 14 EU countries. The direct and indirect relationships between the variables were studied using path analysis. For the whole sample, three additionality dimensions were confirmed; however, the result differs across EU member states. Multi-additionality of EU grants was confirmed only for Spain; in eight EU countries, input and behavioral additionality were proved, and in two, only behavioral additionality was found. This leads to the conclusion that the potential of EU support is not fully exploited, in particular in Central and Eastern European countries, and there is room for improvements with regard to policy design and implementation.", "venue": "International journal of management and economics", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 2, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.2478/ijme-2022-0020", "status": "GOLD", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.2478/ijme-2022-0020?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.2478/ijme-2022-0020, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Case Study: European Union Countries", "abstract": "In the current geopolitical configuration, generated by socio-economic and political-military events, with an impact on economic development, the public debt dynamics take on new dimensions. Public debt, as an indispensable concept for improving development strategies in an economic and geopolitical context, is influenced by the macroeconomic indicators\u2019 variation, but also by the internal and external factors\u2019 impact, which generate instability in a dynamic of unpredictable phenomena. Therefore, the study indicates proposals, based on multivariate regression, to capture the most sensitive variations of macroeconomic indicators on sustainable development at the European Union countries level. Moreover, the current European level configuration requires a detailed capture of the connection between public debt and economic growth, by using a VAR model (public debt, a concept that takes on new values in the current context, and economic growth, as the central pillar of sustainable development, analyzed from the perspective of the studied indicators fluctuation). Finally, I analyzed the public debt dynamics for the next period (2000 \u2013 2022) to create a realistic picture, using the ARMA model. The results confirm the direct impact of each event on economic growth and development, and the limitation and elimination of negative effects vary depending on how it is managed and prevented. Also, the link between the economic growth and public debt is confirmed and, at the same time, it constitutes a benchmark that captures the importance of the decisions of the responsible factors regarding the financial-monetary instruments implemented or what is requested to be adopted. In other words, forecasting the public debt dynamics gives a certain stability, but also a strategic vision, offering viable solutions to support sustainable development efforts at European states level.", "venue": "Scientific Annals of Economics and Business", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 24, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.47743/saeb-2024-0026?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.47743/saeb-2024-0026, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
