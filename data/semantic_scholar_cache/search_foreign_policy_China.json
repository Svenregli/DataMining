It shows that in recent decades China has actively engaged with the elemental IDF regimes at multiple levels \u2013 global, regional, cross-regional, subregional, and bilateral. It argues that the Chinese government has been strategically incoherent in its policy toward IDF governance, lending support to competing models and norms. China \u2019 s \u2018 forum linking \u2019 strategy with regard to multilateral development banks has enhanced international cooperation while its unconventional bilateral development assistance programs have facilitated \u2018 forum shopping \u2019 by the recipient countries, thus undermining the traditional IDF framework. There are multiple sources of China \u2019 s strategic policy incoherence. Besides the country \u2019 s multiple identities and complex interests, this paper highlights the impact of the fragmented nature of the regime complex and Chinese perception of this fragmentation.", "venue": "Global Policy", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 50, "citationCount": 3, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1758-5899.12935", "status": "BRONZE", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/1758-5899.12935?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12935, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
