Manual contouring of organs is time-consuming and can vary among clinicians, potentially impacting treatment accuracy. We aimed to evaluate how well the aforementioned AI tools can assist clinicians by speeding up this process and ensuring precision. Our findings showed that OncoStudio, which was specifically developed for Korean patients, performed better in most cases than Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 AI, a globally developed tool. These results suggest that population-specific AI tools can improve radiation therapy planning, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and reducing clinician workload.", "venue": "Cancers", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers16213670", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11544936, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
