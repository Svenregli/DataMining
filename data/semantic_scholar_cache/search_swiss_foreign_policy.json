Using a most similar comparative case studies design, we examine Switzerland's foreign policy toward South Africa under apartheid for the period from 1968 to 1994 and compare it with the Swiss position toward Iraq after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when the Swiss government imposed\u2014for the first time\u2014comprehensive economic sanctions against another state. The application of the ACF shows that a dominant advocacy coalition in Swiss foreign policy toward South Africa prevented a major policy change in Swiss\u2013South African relations despite external pressure from the international and national political levels. Actually, quite the opposite could be observed: Swiss foreign policy increased its persistence in not taking economic sanctions against the racist regime in South Africa during the 1980s and early 1990s. The ACF, with its analytical focus on policy subsystems and the role of external shocks as potential triggers for change, provided a useful framework for analyzing the factors for policy change and stasis in Swiss foreign relations toward the selected two countries.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 22, "citationCount": 30, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/J.1541-0072.2010.00373.X?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1541-0072.2010.00373.X, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Most of them also contain in-depth analyses of the outcomes of Swiss foreign policy, but rarely address the specificity of the decision-making process. The latter is currently undergoing major changes due to the growing influence of Europeanisation and internationalisation. In recent years we can observe some shifts in the distribution of power and the rise of new actors, the modification of consultation procedures or a reduction in the level of conflict. This is especially evident in European policy, which still remains a special case. Based on the available scientific studies and analyses of different socio-economic statistics, a few interesting conclusions can be drawn about the conditions and determinants of the decision-making processes. A point of reference here is provided by the Schengen/Dublin agreement, which was negotiated and signed in 2004, as a part of the second package of bilateral agreements. Based on this interesting example, the issue of the modern shape of decision-making process in foreign policy and its development over the last few years can be addressed.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount": 5, "citationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://pressto.amu.edu.pl/index.php/pp/article/download/2911/2894", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBY", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14746/PP.2014.19.3.4?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14746/PP.2014.19.3.4, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
