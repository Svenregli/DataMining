This review focuses on two key AI methodologies in healthcare: predictive modeling and causal inference. Predictive models excel in identifying patterns to forecast outcomes but are limited in explaining the underlying causes. In contrast, causal inference focuses on understanding cause-and-effect relationships, which makes effective medical interventions possible. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for causal inference, they face limitations including cost and ethical concerns. As alternatives, emulated RCTs and advanced machine learning techniques have emerged for estimating causal effects, bridging the gap between prediction and causality. Additionally, Shapley values and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations improve the interpretability of complex AI models, making them more actionable in clinical settings. Integrating prediction and causal inference holds great promise for advancing personalized medicine, enhancing patient outcomes, and optimizing healthcare delivery. However, careful application of AI tools is crucial to avoid misinterpretation and maximize their potential.", "venue": "Childhood Kidney Diseases", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": true, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "https://doi.org/10.3339/ckd.24.018", "status": "GOLD", "license": "CCBYNC", "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3339/ckd.24.018?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3339/ckd.24.018, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Medication recommendation aims to integrate patients\u2019 long-term health records with medical knowledge, recommending accuracy and safe medication combinations for specific conditions. However, most existing researches treat medication recommendation systems merely as variants of traditional recommendation systems, overlooking the heterogeneity between medications and diseases. To address this challenge, we propose DGMed, a framework for medication recommendation. DGMed utilizes causal inference to uncover the connections among medical entities and presents an innovative feature alignment method to tackle heterogeneity issues. Specifically, this study first applies causal inference to analyze the quantified therapeutic effects of medications on specific diseases from historical records, uncovering potential links between medical entities. Subsequently, we integrate molecular-level knowledge, aligning the embeddings of medications and diseases within the molecular space to effectively tackle their heterogeneity.Ultimately,basedonrelationshipsattheentitylevel,weadaptivelyadjusttherecommendationprobabilitiesofmedicationandrecommendmedicationcombinationsaccordingtothepatient\u2019s currenthealthcondition.Experimentalresultsonareal-worlddatasetshowthatourmethodsurpassesexistingstate-of-the-artbaselinesinfourevaluationmetrics,demonstratingsuperiorperformance inbothaccuracyandsafetyaspects.Comparedtothesub-optimalmodel,ourapproachimprovedaccuracyby4.40%,reducedtheriskofsideeffectsby6.14%,andincreasedtimeefficiencyby47.15%.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 45, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.48550/arXiv.2403.00880?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2403.00880, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
