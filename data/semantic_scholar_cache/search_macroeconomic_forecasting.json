In Russian-language literature, this psychological aspect of macroeconomic forecasting has not received any attention; our work is designed to fill this gap. As a source of statistical data we used the forecasts extracted from the quarterly Poll of Professional Forecasters (PPF), which began in the first quarter of 2000. An analysis of real GDP and CPI forecasts made it possible to identify optimists and pessimists among independent experts, and also to show that the official forecasts by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and the Bank of Russia are often too optimistic (with the possible exception of forecasts for a current year). It was also confirmed that the accuracy of consensus-forecasts exceeds (in the long run) not only that of official forecasts, but also forecasts made by the vast majority of independent experts. This asserts consensus-forecasts as a benchmark against which macroeconomic forecasts of other experts and organizations should be compared. An analysis of errors for different forecast horizons showed that in the medium term, the most significant ones are associated with underestimation of the resilience of the Russian economy to external shocks. This aspect of macroeconomic forecasting is closely related to forecasting cyclical dynamics (in particular, recessions, their beginning, depth and duration). Currently, this is just what requires additional attention by macroeconomic forecasters.", "venue": "Voprosy Ekonomiki", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 1, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.32609/0042-8736-2024-2-23-48?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.32609/0042-8736-2024-2-23-48, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nevertheless, the real-time dimension of such relationships is less studied, and it remains unclear how to incorporate them in a forecasting framework. This can be partly explained by a certain divide between the economic and political science contributions in this area, as well as by the traditional lack of availability of high-frequency indicators measuring such phenomena. The latter constraint, though, is becoming less of a limiting factor through the production of text-based indicators. In this paper we assemble a dataset of such monthly measures of what we call \u201cinstitutional instability\u201d, for three representative emerging market economies: Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. We then forecast quarterly GDP by adding these new variables to a standard macro-forecasting model in a mixed-frequency MIDAS framework.

The current forecasting literature has focused on matching specific variables and horizons with a particularly successful algorithm. To the contrary, we study the usefulness of the underlying features driving ML gains over standard macroeconometric methods.

To do so, we design experiments that allow to identify the \u201ctreatment\u201d effects of interest. We conclude that (i) nonlinearity is the true game changer for macroeconomic prediction, (ii) the standard factor model remains the best regularization, (iii) K-fold cross-validation is the best practice and (iv) the L2 is preferred to the e-insensitive in-sample loss.
