Access to high-quality healthcare is not just a fundamental human right; it is the bedrock of our societal wellbeing, with the crucial roles played by doctors, nurses, and hospitals. Yet, healthcare systems globally face mounting challenges, particularly from aging populations. Dr Narges Armanfard, affiliated with McGill University and Mila Quebec AI Institute in Montreal, Canada, has spearheaded a groundbreaking initiative \u2013 the iSMART Lab. This laboratory represents a revolutionary leap into the future of healthcare, with its pioneering research in AI for health applications garnering significant attention. Renowned for its innovative integration of AI across diverse domains, iSMART Lab stands at the forefront of harnessing Artificial Intelligence to elevate and streamline health services.\n", "venue": "Open Access Government", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": null, "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.56367/oag-042-11365?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.56367/oag-042-11365, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Nevertheless, getting a doctor's consultation for any health issue is exceedingly challenging. The goal is to employ artificial intelligence to develop a medical chatbot that, when presented with symptoms, can diagnose a patient's condition before the patient ever sees a doctor. A user can determine the actual condition by reporting symptoms of the ailment. [1] The real goal of this activity is to address the user's symptoms and provide medical recommendations based on them in order to save time and money on the procedure. It is a system that interacts with customers through natural language processing (NLP). Chatbots are computer programs that converse with users in natural language. [2] The chatbot saves the information in the database in order to identify the keywords from the sentences, make a decision for the query, and respond to the question.", "venue": "2024 MIT Art, Design and Technology School of Computing International Conference (MITADTSoCiCon)", "year": 2024, "referenceCount": 9, "citationCount": 0, "isOpenAccess": false, "openAccessPdf": {"url": "", "status": "CLOSED", "license": null, "disclaimer": "Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/MITADTSoCiCon60330.2024.10575622?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/MITADTSoCiCon60330.2024.10575622, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.
